Disney Princess Trivia Game!

This is a trivia game that shows only one question for the user to answer quickly before the time runs out.
When the user selects the correct answer, a green dot is added on the bottom of the page. If it is incorrect or the time runs out, a red dot is added to the page.

If the user runs out of time, we will skip to the next question.

On the final screen, the user will see their total score and a button will appear to start again. Depending on which percentage the user gets, a different Disney gif will appear.
